    "2. **The dask workers**. They will do the actual work of running machine\n",
    "   learning algorithms and require their own CPU each.\n",
    "3. **The scheduler**. It manages the communication between the dask client\n",
    "   and the different dask workers. As the client and all workers connect\n",
    "   to the scheduler it must be started first. This is a light-weight job\n",
    "   and does not require its own CPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now start these three components in reverse order: scheduler,\n",
    "workers and client. Also, in a real setup, the scheduler and the workers should\n",
